### The Readme

#### 1. Is the Readme file the first document displayed upon lading the Github?  Does this Readme page include a title, and the name and contact information for all project members?
- Yes, the top of the Readme has all needed information.

#### 2. Is the purpose of this program clear from the Introduction?  What -in your own words- is the motivation behind the program.
- The motivation is clear. The program adds another column with species barcode information using Anacapa to the dataset. This allows the program to match specific barcodes to different Rockfish species. 

#### 3. Is there a program workflow and is it easy to understand?  What -in your own words- is the program workflow?
- I believe the workflow is concise as it describes what each Python script does and how they can be run independently. I think this section needs more detail about the scripts because while it is informative, it feels like an extension of the introduction. 

#### 4. Are the dependencies indicated in the workflow?  If there are Hoffman2 specific requirements are they indicated?
- Yes, they are included. Details about input file type could be added.

#### 5. Are there instructions for running the program?  Do the instructions make sense?  What would you do to improve the instructions?
-Yes, the instructions are explained for each usage type of the program. It will be helpful to add the line "Prior to running..." to the top of the instructions because it seems to be buried. 

#### 6. Is there a section that indicates the files and directories produced by the program?
- The author mentions the name of the output file but a description or example file should be included. 

#### 7. Are the research programs / motivations for the program cited?  Are the dependencies cited?
- Citations for dependencies are included.

### The Scripts

#### 8. Is there a directory that contains all of the program scripts?
- No common directory but all scripts are included

#### 9. Do these programs generate a run log?
- Not needed I think.
---

### The Vignette

#### 10. Is there a directory called Vignette and does it include a test set, the commands used to run the program and the expected output databases?
- Not yet

#### 11. Where you able to run the Vignette using the small test dataset? If not what errors did you get?  If so was it easy to run the dataset?  Where the instructions clear.
- Not yet

#### 12. Where you able to reproduce the expected output?  If not what was different.
- Not yet
---

### General

#### 13. Give __at least two__ suggestions for ways to improve the GitHub page or the operation of the program.
- I think you could improve your readme by highlighting the 3 functions of your program. Once you are ready with the example output, that is defintely needed in the readme and vignette.
